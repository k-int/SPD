SPD Is a web application for tracking schools participation in cultural activities throughout UK libraries, archives and museums. It allows the MLA sector to collate information as a unified whole about the value museums provide to the educational sector. Contributing museums can then report on their own activity and the wider sector to create qualitative reports about usage statistics.
